# 📘 Basic DSA Questions

This repository contains **basic to foundational Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) questions** implemented in **multiple programming languages**.

### 🚀 Goal of this Repository
- Strengthen **DSA fundamentals**
- Practice problems in **Java, C++, and Python**
- Maintain a **language-agnostic problem list**
- Track progress clearly using a **status table**

---

## 🧑‍💻 Languages Used
- ✅ Java  
- ✅ C++  
- ✅ Python  

Each problem may be implemented in **one or more languages** depending on progress.
